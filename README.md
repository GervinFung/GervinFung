Those skills looks very boring and common, because languages with similar syntax isn't listed!

For languages, JVM-based languages like Groovy shared a very similar syntax with Java.
In fact, most OOP langauges do share a very similar syntax and code style, it's exhaustive to list all of it and I do not need to know all OOP languages to use it well

For frameworks, any kind of framework that are built with `tsx` should not be a problem for me to learn quickly.
I had a taste on frameworks like Svelte, Vue and Astro, and to me all frameworks have more similarities than differences, it's not a problem for me to learn if I have to use Angular or any other frameworks that I had not use before

All in all, I'd say it won't take me too long to learn a language/framework,
I should be able to learn a new language/framework within 2 weeks, 1 week if I am familiar with its concept and syntax
